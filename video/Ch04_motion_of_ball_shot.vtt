0:00:09.000 --> 0:00:12.000
This is our version of the classic monkey hunter experiment.

0:00:12.000 --> 0:00:14.000
Here is our projectile.

0:00:14.000 --> 0:00:16.000
Here is our blowgun over here...

0:00:16.000 --> 0:00:20.000
and here is our monkey hanging from electromagnet right over here.

0:00:20.000 --> 0:00:24.000
We are going to take this projectile and push in through using air,

0:00:24.000 --> 0:00:26.000
through this gun,

0:00:26.000 --> 0:00:28.000
which is aimed directly at the monkey.

0:00:28.000 --> 0:00:30.000
As the projectile leaves the end of the gun...

0:00:30.000 --> 0:00:32.000
it will break through this piece of tin foil,

0:00:32.000 --> 0:00:35.000
which is at the end of the gun.

0:00:35.000 --> 0:00:40.000
Which will allow the monkey to start the fall at the same time the projectile leaves the gun.

0:00:40.000 --> 0:00:47.000
Why don't we do the experiment and see what happens.

0:00:47.000 --> 0:01:06.000
** not decipherable** unnatural

0:01:06.000 --> 0:01:10.000
So as you can see is that... as long as the gun is pointed directly at the monkey,

0:01:10.000 --> 0:01:12.000
as soon as the ball leaves the end of the gun...

0:01:12.000 --> 0:01:15.000
it starts to fall due to gravity.

0:01:15.000 --> 0:01:17.000
The monkey is falling due to gravity.

0:01:17.000 --> 0:01:21.000
That's the same lane, so they will meet somewhere along the path of the monkey.

0:01:21.000 --> 0:01:26.000
The speed of the ball leaving the gun is independent of this fact

0:01:26.000 --> 0:01:28.000
and no matter where that monkey is,

0:01:28.000 --> 0:01:30.000
no matter what the speed of the ball...

0:01:30.000 --> 0:01:34.000
it will meet the monkey coming down from the electromagnet.

0:01:34.000 --> 0:01:38.000
But as you can also tell there are no monkeys hurt in this experiment.
