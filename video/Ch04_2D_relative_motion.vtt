0:00:09.000 --> 0:00:13.000
A small toy tractor

0:00:13.000 --> 0:00:18.000
which can move in this direction.

0:00:18.000 --> 0:00:27.000
Piece of paper, which am going to slide and move in this direction.

0:00:27.000 --> 0:00:29.000
If I was to...

0:00:29.000 --> 0:00:32.000
say that the tractor would move across this table in this direction,

0:00:32.000 --> 0:00:34.000
it would do what you would expect,

0:00:34.000 --> 0:00:37.000
move from here to here.

0:00:37.000 --> 0:00:40.000
If I was to say that the paper would move in this direction,

0:00:40.000 --> 0:00:43.000
it would do what you expect.

0:00:43.000 --> 0:00:45.000
Moving across the table...

0:00:45.000 --> 0:00:47.000
falls off the table.

0:00:47.000 --> 0:00:49.000
But in combining the two motions...

0:00:49.000 --> 0:00:52.000
we turn the tractor on...

0:00:52.000 --> 0:00:54.000
we got to move on the paper.

0:00:54.000 --> 0:01:05.000
We now move the paper across the top of the table.

0:01:05.000 --> 0:01:08.000
By combining those two motions we've shown that

0:01:08.000 --> 0:01:12.000
this placement here combined with the displacement in this direction

0:01:12.000 --> 0:01:17.000
goes to result so that... its over here.

0:01:17.000 --> 0:01:21.000
This direction.
