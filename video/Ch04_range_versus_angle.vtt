Lets take a look at the range of horizontal motion of a projectile...

0:00:13.000 --> 0:00:18.000
as a projectile is shot from a gun at different angles.

0:00:18.000 --> 0:00:24.000
We'll first take this gun over here and load it up

0:00:24.000 --> 0:00:28.000
with a ball.

0:00:28.000 --> 0:00:37.000
My assistant Joe Davidson is going to take these three flags and as I shoot this projectile from different angles

0:00:37.000 --> 0:00:39.000
first one at 45 degrees

0:00:39.000 --> 0:00:41.000
the second one at 60 degrees

0:00:41.000 --> 0:00:43.000
the third one at 30 degrees

0:00:43.000 --> 0:00:48.000
He will then place the flags at the different spots that the projectile lands on that table.

0:00:48.000 --> 0:00:58.000
So our first shot is at 45 degrees. Lets take a look at that range.

0:00:58.000 --> 0:01:02.000
Perfect! Thank you Joe!

0:01:02.000 --> 0:01:07.000
Our second shot is going to be at 60.

0:01:07.000 --> 0:01:19.000
I'll change the angle on our gun.

0:01:19.000 --> 0:01:23.000
Thank you Joe!

0:01:23.000 --> 0:01:39.000
And our third... be at 30 degrees.

0:01:39.000 --> 0:01:41.000
Fine

0:01:41.000 --> 0:01:52.000
Joe: Ok.

0:01:52.000 --> 0:01:57.000
As you can see, we shot this projectile at three different angles.

0:01:57.000 --> 0:02:06.000
The maximum range of motion in horizontal direction is achieved at 45 degrees shot.

0:02:06.000 --> 0:02:12.000
The two of 30 degrees and 60 degrees were fairly close to one another on the table

0:02:12.000 --> 0:02:15.000
The reason it dint land directly on one another is because

0:02:15.000 --> 0:02:21.000
this gun actually changes where its flying from as we change this angle.

0:02:21.000 --> 0:02:23.000
So they will be a little bit off.

0:02:23.000 --> 0:02:25.000
However you can tell that they are right next to each other

0:02:25.000 --> 0:02:28.000
from the flags that are placed over there on the table.
