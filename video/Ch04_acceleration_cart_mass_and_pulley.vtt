Lets take a look at as we tag one of our carts here on a track.

0:00:12.000 --> 0:00:17.000
Here we pull them at a constant accelerated rate due to a weight hanging off at the other side

0:00:17.000 --> 0:00:19.000
hanging over a pulley.

0:00:19.000 --> 0:00:22.000
Would do it both on a computer and

0:00:22.000 --> 0:00:34.000
of course you're going to watch it.

0:00:34.000 --> 0:00:36.000
This illustrates the fact that when a...

0:00:36.000 --> 0:00:41.000
the cart is pulled at a constant acceleration from this pulley's system.

0:00:41.000 --> 0:00:48.000
A Velocity is increasing at a steady rate whereas distance versus time is increasing much faster

0:00:48.000 --> 0:00:54.000
and it shows that we have a constant acceleration from the graph.
