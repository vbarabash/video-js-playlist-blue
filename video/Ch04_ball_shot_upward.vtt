0:00:08.000 --> 0:00:13.000
We have a device here called the howitzer cart and if I release the spring

0:00:13.000 --> 0:00:16.000
it launches the ball straight up in the air and gets caught in this cup right here.

0:00:16.000 --> 0:00:21.000
Can also take this howitzer cart and push it across this track.

0:00:21.000 --> 0:00:24.000
Moving in constant velocity.

0:00:24.000 --> 0:00:26.000
Due to both in conjunction,

0:00:26.000 --> 0:00:29.000
Lets watch the motion of the ball as it leaves the howitzer cart

0:00:29.000 --> 0:00:36.000
and see if it lands back in the howitzer cart.

0:00:36.000 --> 0:00:39.000
Before the ball is released from the howitzer cart...

0:00:39.000 --> 0:00:42.000
They both have the same velocity in the x direction

0:00:42.000 --> 0:00:47.000
They velocity is independent of the x direction velocity.

0:00:47.000 --> 0:00:53.000
Hence it doesn't matter how high the ball goes, it still must land back in this cart.

0:00:53.000 --> 0:00:58.000
In this our system consists of the same howitzer cart, the same ball being released.

0:00:58.000 --> 0:01:01.000
However the howitzer cart will now be pulled by a weight

0:01:01.000 --> 0:01:04.000
so it will be on a constant acceleration.

0:01:04.000 --> 0:01:12.000
Lets see what happens.

0:01:12.000 --> 0:01:13.000
As we can see,

0:01:13.000 --> 0:01:19.000
although the ball and the howitzer cart have the same velocity in the x direction when the ball is released.

0:01:19.000 --> 0:01:22.000
The howitzer cart is undergoing an acceleration.

0:01:22.000 --> 0:01:26.000
Therefore the ball, which doesn't accelerate, once it leaves the howitzer cart

0:01:26.000 --> 0:01:29.000
has to land behind the accelerating howitzer cart.

0:01:29.000 --> 0:01:34.000
In this demonstration we are going to release the howitzer cart on an incline.

0:01:34.000 --> 0:01:37.000
The ball will be released the same as before.

0:01:37.000 --> 0:01:48.000
Lets see if it can still catch the ball in the cup.

0:01:48.000 --> 0:01:55.000
In releasing the ball in the incline the howitzer cart has an acceleration in the x direction.

0:01:55.000 --> 0:01:59.000
However the ball also has an acceleration now in the x direction.

0:01:59.000 --> 0:02:05.000
and therefore the howitzer cart will catch the ball every time no matter what the incline is.
