0:00:08.000 --> 0:00:10.000
Here we have two balls

0:00:10.000 --> 0:00:14.000
and also a device which is going to

0:00:14.000 --> 0:00:16.000
take both balls and release them.

0:00:16.000 --> 0:00:20.000
One ball however is going to be hit by this piston when i release it,

0:00:20.000 --> 0:00:23.000
so that it has not only the motion of dropping

0:00:23.000 --> 0:00:24.000
from its surface

0:00:24.000 --> 0:00:29.000
but also a motion in the x direction on this way.

0:00:29.000 --> 0:00:34.000
If I go ahead and put this ball on here

0:00:34.000 --> 0:00:39.000
and pull this, that drops this ball straight down.

0:00:39.000 --> 0:00:44.000
And this is the ball that's going to have a motion also in that x direction.

0:00:44.000 --> 0:00:46.000
Lets watch the balls motion and see what happens.

0:00:46.000 --> 0:00:48.000
And the question ask yourself is

0:00:48.000 --> 0:00:48.000
which ball is going to hit the ground first?

0:00:48.000 --> 0:00:57.000
which ball is going to hit the ground first?
